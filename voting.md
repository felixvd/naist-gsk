## How to vote

Every NAIST student email address is allowed to vote once. In order to vote, write an email to [NAISTStudentCouncil@gmail.com](mailto:NAISTStudentCouncil@gmail.com) from your NAIST email address. You will then receive an email with a personal link to the voting website. Your vote is 100% anonymous.

## Voting details

Every NAIST student can vote for up to three candidates. You can choose to vote for only one or two candidates, but you cannot vote for more than three candidates. You have to click "Done" at the bottom of the page to record your vote.

## Voting outcome

All candidates will be arranged in a list according to their number of votes. The 7 candidates with the highest number of votes will be asked to accept their nomination as a member of the council. If a member does not accept or withdraws from the council, the next candidate is automatically offered to take their position. A member who withdraws can not return as a member of the council until the next election.

Priority is given to candidates such that at least two Japanese students and at least two non-Japanese students are members of the council. As such, if the 10 candidates with the most votes are international students, the two Japanese students will have priority over candidates number 6 - 10. In any case, all seats of the council shall be filled until there are no remaining candidates.

In the event of a draw, the order of the candidates with equal votes shall be decided by a ceremonial game of rock paper scissors.
