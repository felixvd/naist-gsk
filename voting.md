# How to vote / 投票手法

Every NAIST student email address is allowed to vote once. In order to vote, write an email to [NAISTStudentCouncil@gmail.com](mailto:NAISTStudentCouncil@gmail.com) from your NAIST email address. You will then receive an email with a personal link. Note that it can take up to an hour for the link to be sent.

The link leads to a separate website and can only be used to vote once. Your vote is 100% anonymous. Your votes have to be cast by January 30, 11:59 PM GMT+9.

## Voting details / 詳細

Every NAIST student can vote for up to three candidates. You can choose to vote for only one or two candidates, but you cannot vote for more than three candidates. You have to click "Done" at the bottom of the page to record your vote.

## Voting outcome / 結果

The order of candidates will be decided according to their number of votes. The 7 candidates with the highest number of votes will be asked to accept their nomination as a member of the council. If a member does not accept or withdraws from the council, the next candidate is automatically offered to take their position. A member who withdraws can not return as a member of the council until the next election.

Priority is given to candidates such that at least two Japanese students and at least two non-Japanese students are members of the council. In any case, all seats of the council shall be filled until there are no remaining candidates.

In the event of a draw, the order of the candidates with equal votes shall be decided by a ceremonial game of rock paper scissors.

For some more details, see [here](structure).
