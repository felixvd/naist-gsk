# Structure / 構造

The student association consists of 7 elected members (the "Student Council") and more regular members. The 7 council members select the President, Vice-President and Treasurer, who form the board.

Elections for the student council are held annually around August. Council members are elected for one year.

### Formalities for unlikely events

Members of the council can step down and allow the next member in line to join the council.

If fewer than 7 members serve on the council, the council is formally disbanded until the next election. The members of the board retain their functions.

A member of council can be relieved of their duties and excluded from the council if 6 council members and at least 75% of the attending regular members agree to do so in two consecutive, public meetings at least one week apart.
